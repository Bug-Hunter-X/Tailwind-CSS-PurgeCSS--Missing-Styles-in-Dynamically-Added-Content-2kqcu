To fix this, you can use one of the following strategies:

**1.  Whitelist the classes:**

Add the classes used in your dynamic content to the `safelist` array in your Tailwind CSS configuration file (usually `tailwind.config.js`).  For example:

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [ "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
             './index.html',
             './src/pages/*.js',
           ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
  safelist: [ 'bg-blue-500', 'hover\:bg-blue-700', 'text-white', 'font-bold', 'py-2', 'px-4', 'rounded' ],
}
```

**2.  Use a different approach for dynamic styles:**

If you have extensive dynamic styling, consider using a different method that doesn't rely on Tailwind's class-based system. For example, you can add inline styles or use a JavaScript CSS-in-JS library.

**3. Use `@apply` directive (Less Recommended):**
While possible, it's less recommended because it defeats the purpose of utility-first CSS and can make maintenance harder.  This solution involves creating reusable utility classes and applying them. The example remains unchanged in principle.

By incorporating one of these solutions, the dynamically generated content will be correctly styled.
